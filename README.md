##Docker Containers Studies

The goal of this approach is to provide Docker containers dedicated to facilitate Windows/Linux cross-over usage.

Studies are splitted into three domains : 
- Diversity of methods to produce GUI containers to access to Firefox.
- Mono environment to make possible to run Console or Gtk applications.
- Windows Portable-apps (global and dedicated) running with Wine emulator.
 
Experiment by yourself all approaches studies with the links below for Docker containers.
